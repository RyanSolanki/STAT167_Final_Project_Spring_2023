**Data Analysis**
Our data set focuses on the number of car accidents within the state of California from 2016 to 2021, specifically in the Los Angeles County. During our data analysis, we decided to focus on the severity of the crash, measured between 1 to 4 (with 1 having the least impact on traffic and 4 having the most impact) and search for any other variable that played the biggest role in the severity of the car crashes.
```{r}
car_accidents <- read.csv("~/Downloads/STAT167/LA_Accidents.csv")
head(car_accidents, 10)
dim(car_accidents)
glimpse(car_accidents)
median(car_accidents$Wind_Speed.mph.)
```

For my data analysis, I chose wind speed during the specific crash to see if it impacted the severity of the crash itself. I also added a factor of which city that it occurred in to give us any more clarity on the rate of car crashes.
```{r}
ggplot(data = car_accidents) + 
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = Severity, y = Wind_Speed.mph., fill = City))
```

As you can see, the majority of car crashes had a severity score of 2. In addition, the majority of the car crashes had a wind speed within the middle pack of wind speed, at around 5. Furthermore, the majority of car crashes occurred in cities like LA, Malibu, Lancaster, Irwindale. These cities are known to have a larger population than other cities within the LA county so them having the majority of car crashes makes sense.
